# Dave's Sublime-Text user Settings
Sup! These are my magic Sublime Text settings! 
How can you add these to your ST? Well, let's start together!

So, the first thing you'll need to do is to move under **Packages** folder, which
can be found in those folders (**Depending on the OS you're currently using**)

```
Windows: %appdata%/sublime-text3/Packages
MacOs: /Library/Application\ Support/sublime-text3/Packages
Linux: /home/*tuoprofilo*/.config/sublime-text3/Packages
```

Now, all you need to do is to **clone** my repo in **Packages** folder with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daverhapsody/UserSettingsST
```

## For those who have just installed ST:
Before cloning my repo you'll need to install **package control** to your ST, 
and yo install it you just need to open the command view with **ctrl+shift+p** OR
**Command+Shift+P** if you're on Mac OS, and then type "inst".

At this point there should be an option called "**Install package control**", 
click on it, wait 'till it finishes the installation, then you're ready to clone
the repo!

## What is included in my user settings?
A questo punto, rimanendo con il programma aperto, vedrete che si installeranno piano piano tutti i super mega iper fantastici plugin :333
E che plugin ci ho messo? 

1. Some Latex Snippets
2. Java Velocity: Some Java snippets (Some of them are really useful!)
3. LaTeX BlindText e LaTeX snippet: Two sets of snippets for LaTeX
4. Terminus: It's a plugin to use the Terminal as a panel
5. Package Control... Well, obviously!
6. SnippetMaker: It's a plugin which helps on creating new snippets in a fast way,
and these are compatible with ATOM!
7. DeleteBlankLines: The name already says everything, doesn't it? EHEH!

------

Have fun with it! 
Peace,

Dave
